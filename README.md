Sure, here's a basic template for a README.md file for a React Native frontend project:

```markdown
# React Native Frontend Project

This is a React Native frontend project that serves as the client-side application for FullStack Developer Test. It is built using React Native, a JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandrasura25/Full-Stack-Developer-test-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using npm or yarn.

   ```bash
   cd react-native-frontend
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the application**: Start the React Native development server to run the application.

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the Metro Bundler and display a QR code in the terminal. You can scan this QR code using the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to run the application on a physical device, or you can run the application on an emulator or simulator.

## Features

- **Login and Authentication**: Users can log in to the application using their credentials.
- **User Registration**: New users can register for an account by providing necessary details.
- **Tab Navigation**: The application includes a bottom tab navigator with screens for Home, Resources, About, and Profile.
- **Profile Screen**: The Profile screen displays user information after authentication.
